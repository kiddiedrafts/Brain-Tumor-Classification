# Brain Tumor Classification

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying brain tumors from MRI images. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve high accuracy in tumor classification.

The goal of this project is to classify brain tumors into four categories: 
- **Glioma tumor**  
- **Meningioma tumor**  
- **No tumor**  
- **Pituitary tumor**

The dataset used in this project is the Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset from Kaggle.
